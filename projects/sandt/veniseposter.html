              On the occasion of the 58th Venice Biennale exhibition, the
              organization had request posters proposition for alternative
              biennales. The poster proposes an alternative time as if east
              european countries had participated in the 1993 Venice Biennale.
              Those countries were not allowed to exhibit from the past
              biennales during URSS period. Written in Russian, the title means
              “ more it changes… ” and the monument represents the logo of the
              eastern countries organization C.E.I (community of independent
              states).

              <a href="https://slavsandtatars.com/news"> Slavs and Tatars </a>is
              an internationally art collective. The studio practice is based
              primarily on three activities: exhibitions, publications and
              lecture-performance. During my internship I was exposed to the
              various stages leading to a projects’ final. From the early
              creative process (idea, development, research), to the production
              (design, installation, etc).
              <br />
              I was lucky enough to arrive when Slavs and Tatars had wonderful
              projects going on: The ‘Dillio Plaza’ Installation for the 58th
              Venice Biennale exhibition and the curation of the 33rd edition of
              The Ljubljana Biennial ‘ Crack Up – Crack Down ’.
