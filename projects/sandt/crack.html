              On the occasion of the 33rd edition of The Ljubljana Biennial,
              Slavs and Tatars curated an exhibition focused on graphic
              editions, prints, and other works on paper historically. I was in
              charge to prepare the installation and production of artists'
              propositions.
              <br />
              <br />
              -> The mockups and production of Hamja Ahsan’s installation
              <em> The Aspergian Referundum </em>related to his book
              <em>Shy Radicals</em>.
              <br />
              <br />
              -> The video installation of the Yugoslav comedy show Top Lista
              Nadrealista retrospective, which originally ran from late 1984 to
              1991.

              <a href="https://slavsandtatars.com/news"> Slavs and Tatars </a>is
              an internationally art collective. The studio practice is based
              primarily on three activities: exhibitions, publications and
              lecture-performance. During my internship I was exposed to the
              various stages leading to a projects’ final. From the early
              creative process (idea, development, research), to the production
              (design, installation, etc).
              <br />
              I was lucky enough to arrive when Slavs and Tatars had wonderful
              projects going on: The ‘Dillio Plaza’ Installation for the 58th
              Venice Biennale exhibition and the curation of the 33rd edition of
              The Ljubljana Biennial ‘ Crack Up – Crack Down ’.
