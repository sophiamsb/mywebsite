        This photobook is a walk through Brussels. In the making of
        <em>Target</em>, I walked across many streets of Brussels in search of
        front shops that catches my attention.
        <br />
        From all those lookalike shops, we found many of the same and also many
        variations. Signs, products and displays form a vocabulary, and as you
        pass different shops, you discover different kind of intentions.
        <br />
        Big cities resonates with globalization and tourism, it can drives to
        brutal simplicity and sameness. Nethertheless, cities are gathered by
        people from diverse horizons. It creates a sense of complexity, and
        globalization becomes the challenge of the daily street life.
