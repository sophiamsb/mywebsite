    <div class="box">
      On the occasion of the 58th Venice Biennale, Illy collaborated
      with artists to design a collection of cups. The illy cup named
      <em>The Dark One </em>reflects the international nature of Slavs
      and Tatars’ practice and Its devoted taste for multilingualism and
      heterogeneity. It has been designed to celebrate languages by the
      combination of different alphabets lettering the sound ’k’ as an
      homage to /ˈkɒfi/ (coffee).

      <a href="https://slavsandtatars.com/news"> Slavs and Tatars </a>is
      an internationally art collective. The studio practice is based
      primarily on three activities: exhibitions, publications and
      lecture-performance. During my internship I was exposed to the
      various stages leading to a projects’ final. From the early
      creative process (idea, development, research), to the production
      (design, installation, etc).
      <br />
      I was lucky enough to arrive when Slavs and Tatars had wonderful
      projects going on: The ‘Dillio Plaza’ Installation for the 58th
      Venice Biennale exhibition and the curation of the 33rd edition of
      The Ljubljana Biennial ‘ Crack Up – Crack Down ’.
