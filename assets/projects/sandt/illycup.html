              On the occasion of the 58th Venice Biennale, Illy collaborated
              with artists to design a collection of cups. The illy cup named
              <em>The Dark One </em>reflects the international nature of Slavs
              and Tatars’ practice and Its devoted taste for multilingualism and
              heterogeneity. It has been designed to celebrate languages by the
              combination of different alphabets lettering the sound ’k’ as an
              homage to /ˈkɒfi/ (coffee).

              <a href="https://slavsandtatars.com/news"> Slavs and Tatars </a>is
              an internationally art collective. The studio practice is based
              primarily on three activities: exhibitions, publications and
              lecture-performance. During my internship I was exposed to the
              various stages leading to a projects’ final. From the early
              creative process (idea, development, research), to the production
              (design, installation, etc).
              <br />
              I was lucky enough to arrive when Slavs and Tatars had wonderful
              projects going on: The ‘Dillio Plaza’ Installation for the 58th
              Venice Biennale exhibition and the curation of the 33rd edition of
              The Ljubljana Biennial ‘ Crack Up – Crack Down ’.
