        On the occasion of the 33rd edition of The Ljubljana Biennial, Slavs and
        Tatars curated an exhibition focused on graphic editions, prints, and
        other works on paper historically. I was in charge to prepare the
        installation and production of artists' propositions.
        <br />
        <br />
        -> The mockups and production of Hamja Ahsan’s installation The
        Aspergian Referundum related to his book Shy Radicals.
        <br />
        <br />
        -> The video installation of the Yugoslav comedy show Top Lista
        Nadrealista retrospective, which originally ran from late 1984 to 1991.
