      On the occasion of the 58th Venice Biennale exhibition, the
      organization had request posters proposition for alternative
      biennales. The poster proposes an alternative time as if east
      european countries had participated in the 1993 Venice Biennale.
      Those countries were not allowed to exhibit from the past
      biennales during URSS period. Written in Russian, the title means
      “ more it changes… ” and the monument represents the logo of the
      eastern countries organization C.E.I (community of independent
      states).

      <a href="https://slavsandtatars.com/news"> Slavs and Tatars </a>is
      an internationally art collective. The studio practice is based
      primarily on three activities: exhibitions, publications and
      lecture-performance. During my internship I was exposed to the
      various stages leading to a projects’ final. From the early
      creative process (idea, development, research), to the production
      (design, installation, etc).
      <br />
      I was lucky enough to arrive when Slavs and Tatars had wonderful
      projects going on: The ‘Dillio Plaza’ Installation for the 58th
      Venice Biennale exhibition and the curation of the 33rd edition of
      The Ljubljana Biennial ‘ Crack Up – Crack Down ’.
