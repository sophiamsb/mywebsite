        Right / Wrong, it feels like it refers to everything and nothing. Beyond
        this simple duality, what is continually asked is what we can do and
        what we can‚Äôt do. When we need to get things done, we ‚Äôre trying to get
        the right answer or do the right thing, we‚Äôre trying very hard to stay
        on the straight path. Any time, we avoid unwanted turns that seems
        irrelevant and doubtful. But at some point, we have to wonder if the
        thing we‚Äôre pushing away isn‚Äôt more than just annoyance or inefficiency.
        Something more subtle may happened as well.
        <br />
        <br />
        Why is it worth paying attention to wrongness ?
        <br />
        <br />
        Any goal always involves some decision-making under uncertainty. This
        means the opportunity to carve out hidden and special zones. Vanishingly
        rare things are mysterious and surprising. In this case, it turns out
        that nothing is more useful than the useless: unpredictability,
        mistakes, accidents, errors, failures.
        <br />
        <br />
        The dark vastness of possibility is not the opposite of rightness so
        much as its turned echo. Almost doing wrong welcomes this ambiguity by
        looking at exceptions-to-the-rule and special cases. A place whereby
        making decisions can be simultaneously right and wrong. Instead of
        questioning rightness itself, it is important to first grasp wrongness
        as the breaking point of what feels right.

      <div class="textblock">
        Daily, all through our thinking, we‚Äôre trying to keep our mind busy,
        endlessly shifting forces between lack and excessive thoughts. To make
        sense of our life is like seeking problems when there is none. However,
        how can we go much further if we don‚Äôt encounter a problem? Habits are a
        comfort and it‚Äôs good, but at some point, it resonates with meaningless
        routines. Doing something again and again could become boring and
        automatic. To resist boredom, we feel the urge to discover other paths,
        even if it brings complication. As the mind asks for continual change,
        we explore the thread that connects discoveries and habits.

        Anne Friedberg, in her essay,
        <em>Les fl√¢neurs du mal: Cinema and the postmodern Condition </em
        >defines the shopping mall as an ‚ÄòActivity center‚Äô. It‚Äôs a gathering of
        most common stores, restaurants and services joined into one huge space.
        This public space changes the purpose to just go shopping. Shoppers
        visit a mall not only for shopping but also for all types of different
        activities. The accumulation of services and goods, all in one shopping
        mall provides plenty of choices at one‚Äôs fingertips. As we take a walk
        into a shopping mall, we circulate through elevators and stairs,
        switching floors and likely strolling along passageways. The shopper is
        tent to stop as the shop window drives him to enter. Entering the shop;
        interior furnishings, layout, lighting, music and atmosphere, nothing is
        left to chance.

        ‚Äú Ultimately the aims of contemporary architecture and the police
        converge most strikingly around the problem of crowd control‚Ä¶the
        designers of malls and pseudo-public space attack the crowd by
        homogenizing it. They enclose the mass that remains, directing its
        circulation with behaviorist ferocity. ‚Äù

        Containing their own climate within, enabling the streets to be
        enclosed, shopping centers recreate the experience of the city, out of
        any perturbation. The mall creates the illusion of the outdoor, greenery
        landscapes with trees and large plants, sometimes in plastic. Indeed,
        the shopping mall is designed to find solutions against accident and
        noises of the city such as beggars, traffics sounds, weather changes‚Ä¶
        The will to be free of unwanted disturbances manifests how the shopping
        mall is a shield against complications.
        <br />
        <br />
        All-in-one space, to suggest our way to behave and the need to control
        the surrounding; the purpose of the shopping mall certainly is to frame
        what we need. Isn‚Äôt it what we search into habits and familiarities? To
        gain control over our lives? Habits need to be hermetic to change in
        order to be efficient. When we separate daily task from complications,
        the result is an empty action, an automatism. An automatism is a
        instrument to sustain daily life. An automatism is linked with learning,
        it builds progressively a skill as it prevents to start all over again
        from zero. We learn how to read until we no longer realize that we are
        reading.
        <br />
        <br />
        Nonetheless, as habits sustain life as possible, they can also undermine
        it. These two seemingly opposed tendencies, enhancing and diminishing,
        finds an analog in Plato‚Äôs Phaedrus. The Egyptian god of writing, Thoth,
        offers King Thamus writing as a remedy (‚Äú Pharmakon‚Äù) that can help
        memory. King Thamus refuses the gift on the grounds that it will only
        create forgetfulness. It is not a remedy for memory itself but merely a
        way of reminding. Writing is thus a poison (‚Äú Pharmakon‚Äù).
        <br />
        <br />
        The fact we still call the pharmacy drugstore in Anglo-Saxon countries
        shows the ambiguity. This type of ambiguity is also noticeable , in the
        case of the word gift, which means ‚Äògift‚Äô in English and ‚Äòpoison‚Äô in
        German. It seems difficult to resist of the temptation to develop a
        <em>poisoned gift </em>notion to denunciate anything that suffers of
        ambivalence.
        <br />
        <br />
        With digital technologies growing, we leave worries, little by little,
        to the machine. Phones are full of apps applied to make our life much
        easier. Through phones, we can check the weather, stay update, pay rent,
        being reachable everywhere‚Ä¶No doubt there are enormous benefits.
        Technologies are increasingly structured to make us stabilize into a
        routine, everything can be done as quick as possible and it improves our
        life.
        <br />
        <br />
        Although technology might be a useful tool, it can be a poisoned gift
        too. Encouraged by its constant usage, technology can have side effects
        and could lead to an excess of guidance, an impossibility to change, the
        automation of the will. When you always make one decision and stick with
        it, you have only one choice, and that makes you unfree. Technology is
        an automate decision-making which holds down the downsides of accidents.
        In this case, Accidents are seen as superfluous, just a waste of time.
        But every discovery comes with its own unforeseen problems. It‚Äôs nice to
        not know what to expect.

        Autocorrect Fails are funny when something really wrong is still okay
        because you didn‚Äôt purposely make the mistake. You could not predict it
        nor avoid it. Humor arises when something is wrong yet okay, threatening
        yet safe.
        <br />
        <br />
        What‚Äôs happening when the technology goes wrong ?
        <br />
        Taking example of the autocorrect. If the purpose is to correct words,
        this software need to have some definition of correctness. But
        autocorrect efficiency has its limits. When sometimes it fails, it
        reminds us how playful it is to deviate from the right path. Autocorrect
        is a cross over between gaining and losing. Sometimes we need a
        de-automation to have a good laugh.
        <br />
        <br />
        When things goes wrong, it produces an indifference. It shows a detached
        attitude towards what is correct. Boredom does not imply that we should
        do away with all habits, but that we should recognize their limitations.
        Habits can be precious, or not. It could lead to a spontaneous
        expression, or it can be just a phony orchestrated behavior.

        Generally speaking, simplicity is good and complexity is bad. The way
        which we value things depends on what we compare them to. Simplicity is
        with no doubt something to strive for. It gives clarity. Simplicity is
        highly valorized compared to complexity.
        <br />
        <br />
        In the mind, there is a lot of everything and everything seems to be on
        the same level. It is a lack of certainty, nothing is clear. This chaos
        is complexity. In order to manage this chaos, we make things simple. We
        shape things that are far more subtle and complex in reality. To
        simplify is to make a bizarre selection among others.

        The installation of Mark Sanders,<em>Room with Fives </em>, is a room
        filled with small variations of the number five. As the installation
        repeats the number five, those different objects show a constant motion
        of forms, shifting from one state of five to the next. Without a clear
        beginning nor end, the five becomes more complicated: cards, chairs,
        pictures, hands, papers, lines, points‚Ä¶ Five could be anything.
        <br />
        <br />
        With five as the rule, every object is shaped and connected with
        one another. What the rules establish is a range of limitations. The rule is the fact that you need five times: five sugars, five points,
        five lines, five fingers, five pills, the number five, the word five‚Ä¶
        etc.
        <br />
        <br />
        The set of rules (here the five) sounds like it means several things:
        <br />
        - It‚Äôs aimed at representing something.
        <br />
        - Every object you encounter maintains the production of difference, but
        this does not preclude to think all objects look alike.
        <br />
        - Each object is never enough to stop thinking about what could
        represent the set of rule.
        <br />
        <br />
        Our mind makes us stop and think something specific as ‚Äúthis is it‚Äù. But

        The rise of modernism at the beginning of twentieth century is
        characterized by its reaction to the emerging Industrial Age. The basic
        foundation of modernity was said to create an experience that cut across
        all boundaries, re-investing universal themes and trying to escape
        traditional approach. Le Corbusier‚Äôs inspiration compelled him to found a
        timeless architecture.
        <br />
        <br />
        Le Corbusier believed that the solution for social structures lies in
        mathematical ordering of the built environment. Le Corbusier has
        attempted to break with traditions and bypass old-thinking through means
        of going back to first principles. The modern style took a shifting turn
        to start from zero by the use of geometric shapes. Solutions were found
        proposing pure forms: minimal ornamentation, repetitive components, and
        high-rise construction.

        Through the ‚Äòpure form‚Äô aesthetic style, the uniformity of those urban
        structures was to promote a sense of equality among people. Hence, the

        he proposed, in the end, were less equal than he thought but let us put 
        this aside for a second... His aesthetic style did idealise the symbol of the new life.

        Le Corbusier presented his ideas as universal rules. It was reflected in
        his architectural ideas that were said to be easier to reproduce. The
        conception of buildings needed to be prefabricated, in order to create
        the mass-production state of mind. With mass-production manufacturing,
        products needed to be easily and quickly reproduced. Therefore
        ornamentation was considered as wasted labor. Aesthetic‚Äôs criteria were

        <p id="5st">Clich√©, something to start with</p>
      </div>

      <div class="textblock">
        Clich√© is what‚Äôs been given to us before to start anything. Clich√©s are
        surely hard to avoid. How would we live or communicate without clich√©s?
        <br />
        <br />
        The most original, unique intention must start from a clich√©. Something
        clich√© was once specific to a particular time and place. For example,
        the expression¬†‚Äú Better late than never ‚Äù used also in many languages,
        as in french ‚Äú mieux vaut tard que jamais ‚Äù has been repeated many times
        over the centuries. It was first inscribed by the Greek historian
        Dionysius of Halicarnassus in <em>Romaike Archiologia </em>, ‚Äú It is
        better to be late than to never arrive ‚Äù.
        <br />
        <br />
        Clich√© is a variant of the french word <em>cliquer</em> (to click). The
        term was adopted as printer‚Äôs jargon to evoke the clicking sound made by
        the method of printing from a plate. When the expression has started to
        be applied generically, its usage was bound up with processes of
        mechanization, industrialization and with the emergence of print culture
        enabling the mass circulation of texts. Clich√© came also to refer to an
        ‚Äòimage perpetuated without change‚Äô, meaning stereotyped and
        prefabricated. The expression, then, had gained currency in France by
        the 1860s.
        <br />
        <br />
        A clich√© is an outworn commonplace. It works on a contradiction in the
        sense that the effect which the clich√© had once became blunted with
        time. It is something so effective that it gets overused to a point
        where it‚Äôs not effective anymore.
        <br />
        <br />
        In today‚Äôs world, with limitless informations and wide cultural
        productions, a particular thing can become a clich√© extremely fast. The
        unavoidable banalisation of things is what we encounter daily. The

        The zone of normalcy represents what is more appealing to lots of
        people. It represents cultural products that we see more often.
        Everything that lies in the crowd: the mainstream. It is the range of
        products that the public is willing to consider and accept because it
        feels reliable enough. Once something becomes too normalized and
        overused we consider it obsolete. In opposition, when it‚Äôs irrelevant
        and difficult to connect with, we call it experimental.

        The sweet spot shows us things we‚Äôve never seen before. It‚Äôs the
        combination of experimental ideas and existing norms creating a
        conflicting effect. Something still familiar but slightly controversial.
        Something yet difficult to understand but still important. The sweet
        spot is the best outcome of normal.
        <br />
        <br />
        Something novel or innovative can be located within the zone of the
        sweet spot, but it‚Äôs temporary. As time goes, this novelty evolves to
        become a necessity. Later on, it gets overused and loses its
        specialness. Its exceptionality becomes commonplace, the product turns
        into obsolete again.
        <br />
        <br />
        Surely, the sweet spot reverses the outdated norms and making to counter
        obsolescence. It‚Äôs a blind spot allowing us to look outside of
        familiarities. Only until strange becomes the new normal. Meanwhile,
        since the flow of things is constantly shifting, nothing seems really
        special anymore. Novelty is running out. It appears pointless to seek
        always what was not there before and it becomes more difficult to
        recognize anything somehow original. In return, the idea of certain
        aesthetics being ‚Äúin‚Äù and ‚Äúout‚Äù becomes practically obsolete.

        Tourism is known as an activity frequently motivated by the search of
        cultural symbols, charged with old-time nostalgia. Uniqueness is the
        object of the quest. Tourism has triggered a large scale mass production
        ‚Äúsouvenir‚Äù commodities. Mass production has created the potential for
        any object to be seen anywhere, which inevitably has an effect on the
        meaning of things. Mainstream culture and commodity goods present a
        problem for people who believe in the quality of being unique, special
        and priceless. Mona Lisa is a typical example of the most mass-produced
        icon of tourism. It is the must-see clich√© of classical art and it‚Äôs
        even known by just being famous. Mona Lisa has not a unique value
        anymore. Maybe that‚Äôs why tourists crowd around the original Mona Lisa,
        at Mus√©e du Louvre to experience and believe in a way to be in front of
        uniqueness. Fives centuries after Leonardo da Vinci painted the Mona
        Lisa, it became an icon of global culture and has inspired many
        variations, much more far-reaching today with the internet.

        Nothing starts out original. Any cultural form was probably borrowed in
        the first place. Historically, making copies of things was slow and

        While imposing uniformity of presentation (rectangular images with
        maximum size restraint), it indeed creates productive outcomes.
        Genericness is reducing different people to the same standard because to
        reproduce the already known is what matters. Memes must be imitated,
        remixed and diffused to ensure greater spreadable outcomes. Memes being
        anonymous, the publicly shared recognition (going viral) rewards the
        self-expression with likes, reposts, and hearts.
        <br />
        <br />
        Today‚Äôs culture symbols and value rely heavily on how existing materials
        are remixed and rendered new. Although we think remix has the means to
        make many new outcomes, this should not be mistaken with original
        novelty.

        Once a famous mark has been deemed generic, sometimes a mark owner loses
        his right altogether. Many items we use every day, like zippers and
        escalators, were once brand names. Brand names frequently become generic
        terms such as Post it, Jet Ski, PowerPoint, Ping Pong, Kleenex,
        Chapstick, Jacuzzi and many others. We do not search for information, we
        Google it. Not telling we Google something but instead, we search for it
        on Google , what would be the justice in that ? Which one is more
        original ?

        Counterfeit goods and brands is mostly seen as damaging the brand as it
        violates brand identity property right. It breaks the law by making an
        exact imitation of something valuable with the intention to deceive or
        defraud. The country that produces the largest amount of counterfeit is
        China. Everything can be reproduced to the very last detail: mobile
        phones,¬†watches, jewelry, branded clothes, and a long etcetera. In a
        country of fast changes, there‚Äôs no better and cheaper way to keep the
        rhythm with the best and shorten marketing strategies than copying the
        leaders. Counterfeit products are associated with low quality and low
        prices. It‚Äôs done by using value expressing status the brand delivers.
        Moreover, counterfeit is no longer limited to a physical product. It has
        spread to every kind of business, economic activity and services, such
        as duplicating entire stores‚Äô concept.

        One particular kind of counterfeit is <em>Knock off</em>. Because the
        mark has become so desirable to the public, the brand logo is repurposed
        and offered to a broad market. It is not an exact replica. It partly
        keeps the connotation of status by slightly or completely modifying the
        logo. As we compare it with the original logo, its deviation shows a
        brilliant failure. A mark is used to be distinguished from others. Since
        <em>Knock off</em> is understood as appropriation, therefore inevitably
        it brings unsavory meaning from what the famous mark intended. This
        departure from an existing logo leads us to an impasse. Generally
        speaking, a mistake designate the opposite of following rules.

            The ‚Äò80s Harlem Hip Hop tailor: Dapper Dan

        </div>

        Of course, if you‚Äôre going to knock something off, there is a classy way
        to do it. The Harlem designer, Dapper Dan, opened his shop in 1983 and
        took to creating bomber jackets, coats, and suits embossed with logos
        from European fashion brands like Louis Vuitton, Fendi, and Gucci. He
        saw how people on the rise wanted furs, diamonds, and fashion symbols.
        So he found an angle and began to design coats from rolls of fake logos
        prints. As his reputation grows, it made his work more exposed to the
        mainstream and the fashion houses started to become aware of his work.
        Instead of appreciating the homage, they sued him for copyright
        infringement. Confronted with all this legal pressure, Dapper Dan had no
        choice than to shutter his tailoring boutique.
      </div>
      <div class="picture">
        <img src="../img/thesis/dapperdan-schema.jpg " />
      </div>
      <div class="textblock">
        In a surprising turn of events, Dapper Dan now collaborates with Gucci.
        The same luxury brand that once sued Dapper Dan pay homage to his
        designs now. The odd thing was that by using self-made fake logos
        prints, Dapper Dan had taken those luxury brands and pushed them into
        something never seen before. At that time, Louis Vuitton didn‚Äôt make
        clothes at all and Gucci didn‚Äôt make clothes with logos all other them.
        Moreover, Dapper Dan‚Äôs creations sometimes featured three or four marks
        mashed-up together into one creation: one mark as the lining, another
        from the outside, a third for the lapel, an a fourth for as pocket
        squares.
        <br />
        Dapper Dan‚Äôs creations were not mistaken with the ‚Äúoriginal‚Äù thing, it
        was different. He employed the marks in their generic sense, simply
        identifying luxury goods. This is a twisting form of self-expression.
        <br />
        <br />
        Generally, genericness is resisted because it carries the connotation of
        conformity, rather than promising individuality. Some brand names like
        ‚ÄúVetements‚Äù , ‚ÄúCommon threads‚Äù, ‚ÄúUniversal standard‚Äù testifies how
        culture took a different direction where everything has started to look
        like everything else.
        <br />
        <br />
        Vetements brand had the fashion industry in its thrall for the last
        years. People have gravitated towards Vetements because of their
        elevated basics like jeans made from vintage pairs, oversized jackets,
        slogan tees and knockoff T-Shirts (DHL‚Äôs and Champion‚Äôs logos,
        Metallica‚Äôs lightning bolts among many others). The brand‚Äôs offbeat look
        was combined with shows at unconventional locations such as underground
        sex clubs and Chinese restaurant.

        If this DHL T-shirt would not cost 300‚Ç¨, the fashion elite would not
        dare wearing it. The distinction is crucial: while the design may be
        inspired by counterfeit, a fashionista wearing V√™tements does not
        actually want to be mistaken for a lower-life class person. Because a
        fashionista needs to believe this T-shirt is more meaningful than a
        counterfeit. Because V√™tements need to believe that what they‚Äôre
        designing is taken a more valuable root than the actual counterfeit in
        circulation.
        <br />
        <br />
        What V√™tements actually seem to have perfected is the act of
        commodifying a specific anti-attitude, sold to a fashion audience always
        on the look out for a touch of rebellion in terms of style. Their luxury
        strategy relies on what we can‚Äôt do. What was once dangerous and
        forbidden has now turned into a ‚Äúfashion breakthrough‚Äù.
        <br />
        People like associating themselves with things that are transgressive.
        Being at the edge of what determines what is and isn‚Äôt meaningful. Cool
        people try to be uncool, wearing something expensive that doesn‚Äôt look
        expensive. It seems that the aesthetic of counterfeit offered by
        V√™tements is perfectly compatible with a fashion industry based on
        limited stock and high prices, sold back to the fashion elite.
        <br />
        <br />
        Back to the DHL T-shirt, it‚Äôs evident that the line between counterfeit
        and high fashion has become increasingly blurred. The customer is
        willing to spend 300‚Ç¨ for a T-shirt branded with the DHL logo because
        it‚Äôs made by a fashion designer rather than just buying it 10‚Ç¨ on
        Aliexpress. Once we reached this point, no matter which one you wear,
        this T-shirt shows how genericness has become a niche inside which it‚Äôs
        possible to develop ideas and aesthetics beyond what is typically
        thought of as ‚Äúoriginal‚Äù.

        In this show, Nathan Fielder plays an off-kilter version of himself, who
        tries to use his business background to offer terrible advice to (real)
        small business. In the ‚ÄúDumb Starbuck‚Äù episode, Fielder attempts to help
        a struggling coffee shop by renaming it Dumb Starbuck, a strategy to
        attract more customers. As parody law permits a fair use of company‚Äôs
        brands, his idea was to simply appropriate all of Starbucks‚Äô branding
        and call it ‚Äúdumb‚Äù.
        <br />
        <br />
        Legally speaking, unless Nathan Fielder has established himself as a
        parody artist, ‚ÄúDumb Starbucks‚Äù could not possibly exist because people
        would confuse it with the real famous coffee chain. Hence, Nathan worked
        on becoming an established parody artist by writing parodies of classic
        pop songs to perform at an open mic night. He also organized an art show
        containing pieces of parody art of well-known corporate logos like Tank
        of America in lieu of Bank of America.
        <br />
        <br />
        Now he had the evidence to argue that Dumb Starbucks will be just
        another one of his art pieces. Under the law, Dumb Starbucks will not be
        a coffee shop but an art gallery. He posted a craigslist ad searching
        for baristas¬†with Starbucks experience, and hires two applicants. Dumb
        Starbucks, finally opens its door in Los Angeles, selling Starbucks
        products renamed dumb iced vanilla latte, dumb iced cafe mocha‚Ä¶ Even the
        coffee cup sizes were dumb tall, dumb grande and dumb venti.
        <br />
        Within a couple of days, the coffeeshop became a phenomenon, attracting
        dozens of visitors and provoked real international media coverage.
        Hundred of people lined up in order to participate in what many thought
        to believe was a statement against corporations.
        <br />
        <br />
        This episode has carved out an original idea to make fun of Starbucks.
        What is even nicer is that no ones were quite sure what it was in the
        end. Finally, it was only a stupid joke. Overall, it‚Äôs an impressive
        episode of television that creates a mash-up of law, art, commerce and
        mass media.

        Gregory Bateson, an English anthropologist explored social behaviors
        through different types of communication. He articulated a theory about

        Zoo. He discovered the paradox nature of play, taking the example of two
        monkeys playing. In the play, two monkeys perform acts which stand for
        very similar to a fight. Yet, these playful acts are not identical to a
        fight, it‚Äôs not a real fight. The play stands for a fight, but does not
        share the same aggressive meaning. This is a ‚Äúnon-fight‚Äù, they‚Äôre

        Perhaps a peculiar quality emerges in this kind of duality, splitting,
        doubling, reversal, tension‚Ä¶ Any play is a form of resistance. Argument
        or fighting, in its simplest form, is a game: ‚ÄúI say Yes, you say No‚Äù.
        Or just any game like basketball or soccer ‚Äò I try to make a goal, you
        try to stop me‚Äô. Even a sophisticated game like chess, it‚Äôs all about

        Why designate the pipe ‚Äú this is not ‚Äù rather than ‚Äú this is‚Äù? What‚Äôs

        <br />
        There is no obvious answer. Ren√© Magritte is indifferent to make sense.
        He‚Äôs pushing the art of manipulating images and words. He disturbs the
        way images and words try to convey a very specific logic. His tactic is
        to split the logic, by showing that this logic has also the potential to

        not to say that it‚Äôs pointless. In this seeming indifference, Ren√©
        Magritte plays upon the bond of meaning by taking no position, without
        affirming anything nor representing. He leaves things ambiguous.
        Everything is nothing with a twist. This is an aestheticized paradox. It
        suggests that if we want to go off the grid, drop out and switch things
        off, then we should challenge the range of accepted thought.

        Way back in the Renaissance period, the perspective became a successful
        system of representation. Before to call it ‚Äúperspective‚Äù, it was
        ‚Äúcommensuratio‚Äù. It meant that the world became measurable to mankind.
        ‚ÄúMan is the measure of all things‚Äù said Protagoras.
        <br />
        <br />
        Perspective was not a single thing but a combination of elements that
        extended as far as art, geometry, mathematics and scientific
        instruments. Art and science wanted to create a rational framework into
        mathematically and geometrically ordered and limited space. At the same
        period, space was measured in cartography and time was measured thru the
        mechanical clock. The perspective was meant to build an ideal
        proportion, ordered and harmonious vision of the world. Greatly
        representing the visible world as realistic as possible.

        However, some deviations of the perspective started to evolve in the
        15th century. Dealing with geometrical issues, Piero Della Francesca
        pointed out the fact that sometimes distortion of objects (anamorphosis,
        foreshortening) will appear while following laws of perspective. These
        discoveries became a comment about limits of perspective.
        <br />
        Some artists (Piero Della Francesca, Andrea Mantegna, Leonardo Da
        Vinci‚Ä¶) were enticed by a form of perspective that was aimed to produce
        a mystery.
        <br />
        How to represent the unrepresentable?
        <br />
        What cannot be seen should be figured with a clever insight: the
        distortion of perspective.

        The Annunciation is a great story to question the limits of
        perspective‚Äôs laws. Whatever is worth measuring the world, there are
        aspects of reality we can‚Äôt measure.
        <br />
        In The Annunciation of Piero Della Francesca, the classical
        perspective‚Äôs laws of the ‚Äúmeasurable‚Äù are combined with intern
        distortion to express ‚Äú the immeasurable‚Äù. The distortion is used to
        figure a moment impossible to represent.
        <br />
        <br />
        Gabriel is on the left side, Mary on the right side. Between both, a
        corridor with a very long perspective of colonnades. Above this corridor
        ‚Äúthe divine light‚Äù appears symbolized by the dove. The distortion is not
        immediately apparent, it is subtly hidden, waiting to be recognized. If
        we look closer, there is indeed something hidden. The corridor between
        both of them is actually longer than it should be.
        <br />
        A column hides Mary. If Gabriel raises his eyes, it is not Mary he sees,
        but a massive column. Moreover, Piero Della Francesca intensifies the
        distortion by placing a marble slab at the end of the corridor which
        almost breaks the effect of perspective that he has created with the
        colonnades of the corridor, as if the marble slab was nearby on the
        front.
        <br />
        <br />
        Why a composition so realistic in appearance had to produce so many
        ‚Äúmistakes‚Äù?
        <br />
        <br />
        A mistake relies on the incalculable, the indemonstrable, the imperfect.
        It is clear that Piero Della Francesca intentionally wanted to build a
        non-rigorous representation to attract viewer attention by using intern
        distortion. In a representation pushed to perfection, imperfection will
        stand out. Many subtle rules have created this painting, seemingly
        limpid and clear, but revealing itself at the end as an ambiguous image:
        the reverse perspective of the perspective.
        <br />
        <br />
        Perspective is symbolically imposing an idealized viewpoint of reality
        over any other. Therefore, it‚Äôs worth reconsidering its self-evident
        character. Distortion is showing an ‚Äúoff-stage‚Äù side of the perspective
        by strategically highlighting its intern limitations. It intentionally
        reveals perspective‚Äôs paradoxical nature: the world is available to us
        geometrically and mathematically, but only in so far as we embrace the
        illusions through which this reality is conveyed.
        <br />
        <br />
        Distortion is drawn according to the laws of perspective. Therefore
        perspective‚Äôs laws are disturbed, but not too much. At least objects,
        space, and stories don‚Äôt loose their evident clarity. Because we do love
        convention and things reduced to a norm, limits of any exploration are
        always restored through a clearly marked area.

        Endlessly making the same gesture is either boring or fascinating.
        Cultural production is a field in which we give shape to our values,
        behavior and way of life. But it‚Äôs not necessary a good thing.
        Sometimes, it‚Äôs just a grim acceptance that cannot hold complexity and
        uncertainty.
        <br />
        <br />
        What if cultural production is currently tied up to a particular power:
        normalization. Normalization is in a way, a general instrument that can
        be found everywhere and generally accepted. As much as they materialize
        an ephemeral devoid of meaning, standards and norms play a critical role
        to determine through which new forms may come forth.
        <br />
        <br />
        Crossroads of aesthetics, norms, and cultures are a messy business. We
        live among variety, but as if there‚Äôs nothing worth the price anymore,
        it feels like an exhausting meaningless fatigue. New trend and
        approaches are endlessly spread like wildfire to extinguish what existed
        before. Cultural production just renews itself for no particular reason
        other than to provide something new for us to consume. The production of
        the new is bound to struggle in a system in which everything is visible,
        accessible, and normalized.
        <br />
        <br />
        In order to understand obsolescence, it is thus important to purchase
        wider concerns about cultural banality of mass consumerism. The remix is
        still somehow an obscure mode of production that makes us realize that
        culture can be indefinitely malleable and it requires to cultivate a
        capacity to adapt to any situation. At time goes, the generic and the
        unique exists at the same time.
        <br />
        <br />
        The question of limits is useful to understand the process of product
        cycle. In a society pushed to perfection, imperfection will stand out.
        The common strategy deployed in the creation of the new is to challenge
        existing norms. Thankfully, the margins of cultural production exist,
        otherwise the world will be so clear. It questions what we consider
        valuable by placing ordinary or banal objects into unfamiliar and
        contradictory contexts, thereby altering their meaning.
        <br />
        <br />
        All opposition meets in the middle. If everything has its opposite, Its
        because culture production used this logic to communicate and reproduce
        values. Looking at what often been thought as duality, it is playground
        willing to negotiate a reality that otherwise we avoid or are estranged
        from.
        <br />
        <br />
        Why cultural production has to repeat the clich√© of ‚ÄòRule-Breaking‚Äô?
        <br />
        As to prevent aesthetic forms of coming to an end, keep everything in
        play is a ruse to resist boundaries. ‚ÄòRule-Breaking‚Äô looks forward, not
        to find a timeless meaning, but to repeat an ongoing play in which
        aesthetics will require constant reinterpretations. Most of the time,
        something wrong is seen as unnecessary when it contrasts itself with the
        notion of quality. But sometimes, doing something wrong testifies that
        contradictory approaches can emerge as a powerful statement.
